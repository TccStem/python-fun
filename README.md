## Thus Far

Thus far we have covered the basics of programming including:
* variables and variable types
* `if`, `else if`, `else` statements
* lists (`[]`) and dicts (`{}`)
* `while`, `for` loops
  - `break`, `continue`
* functions
  - `def`, `return`
  
## Current Projects

### Pong

So far we have created the mainloop for a graphical window using tkinter.
Additionally, we have created our own mainloop that handles user input (key presses).

In the next programming meeting, we will handle all of the logic that will draw the two paddles and the ball
so as to mimic.
